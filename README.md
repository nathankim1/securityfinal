# Final Project for ECE 379K - Computer Security.
Repository modeling two software supply chain attacks - a library dependency and a VS Code extension.

Attacker will create a malicious library and VS Code extension as well as a webserver (Python Flask) to receive messages from the victim.
The Victim will have a mock web application that uses the malicious library and VS Code extension.

This project will model the security risks of current developer development ecosystems with reliance on third-party software.
